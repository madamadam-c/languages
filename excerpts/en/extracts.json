He served as the sixth Commissioner of Church Education from 1928 to 1933. Prior to his service as commissioner, he played a significant role in the creation of the LDS Church's \"released time\" seminary system. His tenure as commissioner also saw creation of the Institutes of Religion and the transfer of nearly all the remaining church schools to control of the states they resided in. He also faced a crisis in 1930 and 1931 which threatened to end the released time seminary, but the LDS Church education system survived the Great Depression under his leadership. In 1931, while still serving as commissioner, Merrill was called to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles."

It is part of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, and is one of four cemeteries in the complex.\nThe third cemetery to be established in the monastery complex, the Nikolskoe Cemetery opened in 1863, and rapidly became a popular and exclusive burial site for the elite of Saint Petersburg society. It was carefully arranged and landscaped, with its cemetery church opening in 1871. Taking its name from this church, the Church of St. Nicholas, the cemetery functioned also a burial ground for the clergy and monks of the monastery. The wealthy and important of the city commissioned large and elaborate memorials during the later years of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth.\nThe cemetery fell into disrepair during the Soviet period. Unlike other cemeteries in the Lavra, it was not considered to have any particular historical or artistic value. The church was closed and repurposed, burials ceased, and some memorials of more significant figures were moved to other cemeteries, while others were lost or deliberately destroyed. Restoration work began in the 1970s, returning the site to its park-like form. A columbarium was built, the cemetery church reopened, and work to repair and refurbish the monuments began. Burials recommenced in the late 1970s, and now the cemetery includes prominent figures of Soviet and post-Soviet society, as well as those of the era of Imperial Russia.\n\n"

Danziger Jr. Memorial Lecture in the Humanities is an annual honorary bestowed upon an \"established scholar of classical literature, who has made substantial contributions to the critical analysis of classical literature, or has been exceptionally skilled at inspiring an appreciation for classical literature\" by the Humanities Division of the University of Chicago.\nSigmund H Danziger Jr. (1916\u20131979) founded Homak Mfg. Co. Inc. in 1947 in Chicago.  A Chicago southsider and son of a sales representative for houseware products, including bathroom scales, Danziger began his business career \"jobbing\" for Chicago manufacturers while a student at the University of Chicago (graduated 1937). After the World War II, in which he served as a captain and translator, he purchased a bathroom cabinet manufacturer on the south side of Chicago for which he was jobbing. Naming the new company Homak, capturing a sign he noted on a hat store, he began manufacturing steel kitchen cabinets and rapidly moved to a 35,000 sq ft (3,300 m2) building, which he designed at 4433 S. Springfield Ave in Chicago. In the early 1960s, an order for tool boxes lead to the production of a hardware line including roller cabinets, tool boxes, and other accessories. Through the 1970s and 1980s, most of the major retailers and chains of the time became either line or private label customers at one time or another, including Sears, Walmart, Kmart, Lowe's, The Home Depot True Value, Ace Hardware, Montgomery Ward, Coast-to-Coast, Costco, Meijer, Pep Boys, Fingerhut, NAPA, Restoration Hardware, etc.  In 1979, Sigmund Danziger died and his wife Gertrude (Trudy)(1919-2021), who was known as \"The Toolbox Lady\" in the hardware industry, ran the company for the next 25 years.   During this time, the company moved to a 400,000 sq ft (37,000 m2) facility in Bedford Park, Illinois at 5151 W 73rd St. while sales grew to over $100,000,000 with hardware, automotive, hospital (under Homed TM), and sporting goods lines. One of the major innovations during this period was the introduction of a consumer gun cabinet (under HomSafe TM), which instantly grew to be a major hit at mass retailers, including Bass Pro Shops, Gander Mountain, Dick's Sporting Goods and Sports Authority. Also a line of garage cabinets was introduced for Whirlpool and Sears under the label \"Gladiator Garageworks.\" Homak employed hundreds of people, who enjoyed the prosperity of the industry, and was the largest privately held sheet-metal fabricator in America.\n\n"

Haldimann was the co-founder of the Frauenkomitees gegen die Einf\u00fchrung des Frauenstimmrechts in der Schweiz (English: Women's Committee against the introduction of women's suffrage in Switzerland) in 1958. The committee eventually established the Bund der Schweizerinnen gegen das Frauenstimmrecht (English: Federation of Swiss women against women's suffrage) in 1959 of which she was the first chairperson until 1967. Comparing Switzerland to other European countries in which women were allowed to vote, she defended the direct democracy of Switzerland and deemed the women's suffrage as impossible to coexist with it. In 1967 she resigned from the federation's presidency, with Ida Monn-Krieger succeeding her. But Haldimann stayed an active member of the federation and was elected the federations \"Honorary President\". Four days before the referendum, Haldimann took part in a panel in Wohlen which counted with representatives of several parties and Trudi Gerster, who was a member of the Grand Council of Basel and strongly supported the women's suffrage.  \nGertrud Haldimann married to Carl Haldimann and had six children.\n\n"

Tsubame gaeshi as a counter against uke's Deashi harai is the opening move of the Kaeshi-no-kata. As a counter against Okuriashi harai, it forms the sixth technique of the Nage-Waza-Ura-no-kata.\nThe name Tsubame Gaeshi is a reference to the famous technique of the legendary Japanese swordsman Sasaki Kojir\u014d.  It was an overhead katana (or, in Sasaki's case, a nodachi) stroke that was performed so swiftly it resembled the flight of a swallow, hence the name."

The Rama Natakam is even more similar to the Tamil version than the Sanskrit version in many aspects \u2013 both in spiritual concepts and in the specifics of the storyline. Several songs of this opera are well known and sung all over Tamil Nadu. Arunachala Kavirayar studied Sanskrit and Tamil in the Dharmapuram Adheenam and excelled in his studies . After his marriage he set up a pawn-broker shop, This not only provided him with a good living, but also with a fair amount of Leisure to pursue his literary studies. Just as he was good at \u201cestimating the fineness of the precious metal, he was equally proficient at estimating the worth of the literary works.\u201d Two books were most liked by Kavirayar \u2014 The Tirukkural of Tiruvalluvar and the Ramavataram of Kambar, While the former was only a book of ethics, the latter gave the same in the form of a story which would be more appealing to the common man."

The 303rd flew missions over the Hump before being disbanded when Air Transport Command abandoned the traditional squadron and group organization for its operations in the China Burma India Theater.\nThe second predecessor of the squadron was the 483rd Bombardment Squadron, a very heavy Boeing B-29 Superfortress bomber squadron that, after training in the United States, moved to Tinian and engaged in the strategic bombing campaign against Japan from Tinian, earning two Distinguished Unit Citations for its combat actions.  It then moved to the Philippines, where it was inactivated in 1946.\nThe unit's third predecessor is the 303rd Air Refueling Squadron, which served during the Cold War to support Strategic Air Command bombers.  For most of its active life, the squadron operated from a forward base in the middle Atlantic to support reflex deployments and maintained readiness to support Emergency War Order missions.\nIn 1985, the United States Air Force consolidated three squadrons, but they have not been active since the consolidation.\n\n"

Limerick leasing from Sir Matthew Barrington, 2nd Baronet of the Barrington baronets of Limerick. He married Margaret Ryan in 1841. He was father-in-law to the Irish revolutionary activist Nell Humphreys.\nHe became a Poor Law Guardian for the Poor Law Union of Limerick and is described as such in an 1876 newspaper report and in an 1882 court dispute with his landlord Sir Croker Barrington, 4th Baronet about payment of rent. As a result of the dispute, Barrington put the lease on the Humphrys farm at Glenstal up for sale, and Humphrys had to buy it back, which he did.  In 1883, he sued Sir Croker Barrington for having allowed sheep to trespass on his lands at Glenstal. He won the case, and Sir Croker was fined.\nJames Humphrys died in 1899 and Margaret Humphrys in 1909. On her death there was a vote of sympathy at meeting of Limerick Guardians.

In his anger at his brothers for separating their parents, T\u0101whirim\u0101tea destroyed the forests of T\u0101ne (god of forests), drove Tangaroa (god of the sea) and his progeny into the sea, pursued Rongo and Haumia-tiketike till they had to take refuge in the bosom of their mother Papa, and only found in T\u016bmatauenga a worthy opponent and eternal enemy (Tregear 1891:499). To fight his brothers, T\u0101whirim\u0101tea gathered an army of his children, winds and clouds of different kinds \u2013 including Ap\u016b-hau (\"fierce squall\"), Ap\u016b-matangi, Ao-nui, Ao-roa, Ao-p\u014duri, Ao-p\u014dtango, Ao-wh\u0113tuma, Ao-whekere, Ao-k\u0101hiwahiwa, Ao-k\u0101napanapa, Ao-p\u0101kinakina, Ao-pakarea, and Ao-t\u0101kawe (Grey 1971). Grey translates these as 'fierce squalls, whirlwinds, dense clouds, massy clouds, dark clouds, gloomy thick clouds, fiery clouds, clouds which preceded hurricanes, clouds of fiery black, clouds reflecting glowing red light, clouds wildly drifting from all quarters  and wildly bursting, clouds of thunder storms, and clouds hurriedly flying on' (Grey 1956:5). \nOther children of T\u0101whirim\u0101tea are the various kinds of rain, mists and fog. T\u0101whirim\u0101tea's attacks on his brothers led to the flooding of large areas of the land.

        "extract": "Thermization, also spelled thermisation, is a method of sanitizing raw milk with low heat. \"Thermization is a generic description of a range of subpasteurization heat treatments (57 to 68\u00b0C \u00d7 10 to 20 s) that markedly reduce the number of spoilage bacteria in milk with minimal heat damage.\" The process is not used on other food products, and is similar to pasteurization but uses lower temperatures, allowing the milk product to retain more of its original taste. In Europe, there is a distinction between cheeses made of thermized milk and raw-milk cheeses. However, the United States' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) places the same regulations on all unpasteurized cheeses. As a result, cheeses from thermized milk must be aged for 60 days or more before being sold in the United States, the same restriction placed on raw-milk cheeses by the FDA.\nThermization involves heating milk at temperatures of around 145\u2013149 \u00b0F (63\u201365 \u00b0C) for 15 seconds, while pasteurization involves heating milk at 160 \u00b0F (71 \u00b0C) for 15 seconds or at 145 \u00b0F (63 \u00b0C) for 30 minutes. Thermization is used to extend the keeping quality of raw milk (the length of time that milk is suitable for consumption) when it cannot be immediately used in other products, such as cheese. Thermization can also be used to extend the storage life of fermented milk products by inactivating microorganisms in the product.\nThermization inactivates psychrotrophic bacteria in milk  and allows the milk to be stored below 8 \u00b0C (46 \u00b0F) for three days, or stored at 0\u20131 \u00b0C (32\u201334 \u00b0F) for seven days. Later, the milk may be given stronger heat treatment to be preserved longer. Cooling thermized milk before reheating is necessary to delay/prevent the outgrowth of bacterial spores. When the milk is first heated, spores can begin to germinate, but their growth can be halted or delayed when the milk is refrigerated, depending on the microorganisms' growth requirements. Germinated spores are sensitive to subsequent heating, however since germination is not a homogeneous process, not all spores will germinate or be inactivated by subsequent heating.\n\n"

In 2016, Reporters Without Borders ranked Mexico 149 out of 180 in the World Press Freedom Index, declaring Mexico to be \u201cthe world's most dangerous country for journalists.\u201d Additionally, in 2010 the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that Mexico was \"one of the worst nations in solving crimes against journalists.\" Under the current Mexican Constitution, both freedom of information and expression are to be protected under the legislation from Article 6, which states that \"the expression of ideas shall not be subject to any judicial or administrative investigation, unless it offends good morals, infringes the rights of others, incites to crime, or disturbs the public order,\" and Article 7 which guarantees that \"freedom of writing and publishing writings on any subject is inviolable. No law or authority may establish censorship, require bonds from authors or printers, or restrict the freedom of printing, which shall be limited only by the respect due to private life, morals, and public peace.\" Mexico is currently a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which gives them the responsibility to uphold these established laws regarding freedom of expression.\nGovernment corruption found within Mexico has been linked with the killing of journalists. Many deaths since the beginning of the Mexican Drug War have been linked to drug cartels and government officials connected to cartels since 2000. Different administrations have attempted different policies, but the issues of corruption have prevented widespread success of these policies. Mexico is consistently graded low in their corruption and safety for journalists. Transparency International gave Mexico a 31/100, ranking it at 126 out of 180 countries that were graded.\nMexico also prohibits cultural appropriation."

Sometimes, the term is also used to describe the six major areas of law. Furthermore, it may refer to all or part of a collection of statutes.\n\nThe word ropp\u014d is a slightly adapted form of the word used in Japanese to describe the Napoleonic Code (\u30ca\u30dd\u30ec\u30aa\u30f3\u4e94\u6cd5\u5178 Napoleon go-h\u014dten) when it was brought over during the early Meiji period. Although, French Emperor Napoleon enacted five major codes, which were, in Japanese, altogether metonymically referred to as \"the Napoleonic Code\" (the official name of the Civil Code, the first and most prominent one), the Japanese added to this their own constitution to form six codes in all, and thus it came to be called the ropp\u014d or \"six codes\".\nLegislation in Japan tends to be terse. The statutory volume Ropp\u014d Zensho (literally: Book of Six Codes), similar in size to a large dictionary, contains all six codes as well as many other statutes enacted by the Diet.\nThe Six Codes were introduced to China in 1905 after the reform and modernization of the Chinese legal system led by Cixi. Such reform was based on the similar laws adopted in Germany, France, and Japan. After the establishment of Nationalist Government, the Complete Book of Six Codes was passed on October 3 1928. The Chinese Communist Party abolished the practices of Six Codes on the land of Communist control in February 1949.\nAs a result of Japanese colonial rule and the Retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, the legal system in Taiwan is strongly influenced by Japan and China. As a result, the terms Six Codes and Book of Six Codes are also widely used in Taiwan."

        "extract": "The Battle of La Haye-du-Puits was fought between the armies of the United States and Germany as part of the Normandy Campaign of World War II. Following the Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day, 6 June 1944, US First Army under the command of Lieutenant General Omar Bradley began an advance to the south, aiming to break through the German defenses and secure a line from Coutances to Saint-L\u00f4. This would help the rest of the First Army cross the swamps and bocage, and put the American front on firm and dry ground more suitable for the employment of mechanized forces. Although the battle was costly for the Americans, it was also costly for the Germans; by wearing down their forces, it paved the way for Operation Cobra on 25 July, which broke through the German defenses.\nThe most striking geographical feature of the area was the bocage, earthen embankments topped with small trees and tangled underbrush and vines, separated by sunken lanes. The hedgerows provided cover, camouflage and concealment to the German defenders, which reduced the effectiveness of American artillery. Small detachments defended each field. The terrain favoured the defense, and the German LXXXIV Corps under the command of GeneralleutnantDietrich von Choltitz effectively utilized the bocage with defensive tactics. The German Seventh Army commander, SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Paul Hausser, echeloned his forces in a defense in depth, manning the forward area lightly with prepared fallback defensive positions, and hoarded the bulk of his troops, tanks and assault guns for counter-attacks.\nBetween 5 and 14 July, the American troops of the VIII Corps under the command of Major General Troy H. Middleton's   pushed southward through forest, swamps and bocage to capture the high ground around La Haye-du-Puits. The advance was bitterly contested. The 82nd Airborne Division achieved some success, taking the key positions of Hill 131 and La Poterie ridge. The 79th Infantry Division captured Hill 121 and make progress towards Montgardon ridge. The 90th Infantry Division fought through heavy German resistance to capture Mont Castre ridge and advance towards P\u00e9riers. The 8th Infantry Division captured the ridge overlooking the Ay River. The Americans reached their objective, the S\u00e8ves River, on 14 July.\n\n"

Decorated several times throughout his service in the First World War, Murray rose from the rank of private to lieutenant colonel in three and a half years. He is often described as the most highly decorated infantry soldier of the British Empire during the First World War.\nBorn in Tasmania, Murray worked as a farmer, courier and timber cutter before enlisting in September 1914. Assigned to a machine gun crew, he served during the Gallipoli Campaign, where he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal before the withdrawal from the peninsula. He was later transferred along with the rest of his battalion to France for service on the Western Front, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order during the Battle of the Somme. In February 1917, Murray commanded a company during the battalion's attack on the German position of Stormy Trench. During the engagement, the company was able to capture the position and repulse three fierce counter-attacks, with Murray often leading bayonet and bombing charges himself. For his actions during the battle, Murray was awarded the Victoria Cross. Soon after his Victoria Cross action, he was promoted to major and earned a Bar to his Distinguished Service Order during an attack on the Hindenburg Line near Bullecourt. Promoted to lieutenant colonel in early 1918, he assumed command of the 4th Machine Gun Battalion, where he would remain until the end of the war.\nReturning to Australia in 1920, Murray eventually settled in Queensland, where he purchased the grazing farm that would be his home for the remainder of his life. Re-enlisting for service in the Second World War, he was appointed as commanding officer of the 26th (Militia) Battalion. Taking his discharge in 1944, Murray returned to his farm and died in 1966 at the age of 85.\n\n"

It is widely regarded as a masterpiece that had a major influence on bands such as U2  (who toured with the band) and later groups such as Editors and Interpol. The album has been reissued on CD four times, in 1995 by RPM Records, in 2006 by Renascent, in 2015 by Edsel Records and in 2024 by Music on CD, each with different track listings (see below). Sleep No More produced no singles, but it had the highest UK chart ranking for any Comsats album, peaking at No. 51.\nAfter the rushed production of the first album, Waiting for a Miracle, the band was able to put a lot more craft into Sleep No More. Frontman Stephen Fellows described how they achieved a resonant sound on a couple of the tracks: \"Pete Wilson suggested taking the drums out of the studio \u2013 on the fourth floor at Polydor \u2013 and putting them near the lift-shaft (elevator shaft) by the stairs. We then put microphones on the three floors above and below  ... Obviously we were only able to do this sort of thing in the evening when the offices were closed!\"\nFellows felt the album Sleep No More had a unique quality among the band's work: \"The only [album] which had a 'thread' through it was Sleep No More, the 'thread' was the sound we wanted to get.\" Critics recognized it as a great follow-up to Waiting for a Miracle. AllMusic later said, \"Sleep No More is certainly more powerful, and it's also a greater achievement. Here The Comsat Angels became one of the era's exceptional bands.\" In a 1981 review, Mark Cooper of Sounds wrote that it was \"an album that is head and shoulders above anything else recorded this year\", while Jack Rabid of The Big Takeover summed up the album by saying, \"I think Sleep No More is one of the greatest pieces of music ever released!\"\nWhen Sleep No More was released, it sold out very quickly. Unfortunately Polydor took two weeks to ship additional stock to the record stores, an issue which was believed to have had a negative effect on the album's momentum."

The deposit has been explored to depths of up to 1,300 metres (4,300 ft) and the geological reserves amount to 12 million tonnes of which 7.5 million tonnes grading over 38% chromium metal.\nThe Krasta mine began operating in 1963. Between 1963 and 1965 it produced chromium ore only from occurrences. In 1971 production from the mine started. The total combined chromium ore production from the mine between 1971 and 2006 amounted to 716,000 tonnes. The deepest level of the mine is the Level +400 which reaches a depth of 400 metres (1,300 ft). The chromium ore reserves of the mine are split into two categories above and below Level +400. The proven ore reserves located above the Level +400 amount to 2,000,000 tonnes of ore grading 40% chromium metal. The proven ore reserves located below the Level +400 are currently not estimated or calculated but are expected to be grading over 40% chromium metal. The mine's total reserves amount to 2 million tonnes of ore grading 40% chromium metal. Since 1999 several parts of the mine were privatised and the other were closed. In 2006, it was estimated that a total of 2 million tons chromium ore were still unexploited in the mine of Krasta, making it the 2nd after Bulqiz\u00eb mine in terms of chromium reserves in Albania,:\u200a48\u200a while being one of the eight Albanian chromium mines to have reserves of over 1 million tonnes of chromium ore. Krasta mine is also considered to be a source of rare metals such as platinum and cobalt, nevertheless their exploitation today is inaccessible."

        "extract": "Eliza Woods was an African-American woman who was lynched on 19 August 1886 in Jackson, Tennessee, after being accused of poisoning and killing her employer, Jessie Woolen.\nWoods had been Woolen's cook. When it was found that Woolen's stomach contained arsenic and that Woods had a box of rat poison at home, it was concluded that she was responsible for the death. A crowd of 1,000 was reportedly present when Woods was dragged from the jail and hanged naked in front of the courthouse. Bullets were then shot into her body.  This lynching was notable both for the gender of the victim and the biracial participation of the crowd.  Three years later, in 1889, Woolen's husband confessed that he had killed his wife.\nThe case was among the first that Ida B. Wells (1862\u20131931) wrote about before becoming a prominent anti-lynching campaigner.\nIn 2020, a plaque detailing the lynching was installed at the courthouse where Woods was hung.\n\n"

In a soft dollar arrangement, the investment manager directs commissions generated by a client's or fund's transactions to a broker-dealer or other trading venue. Soft dollars, in contrast to hard dollars (actual cash) which have to be reported, are incorporated into brokerage fees and paid expenses, which may not be reported separately (partly due to the difficulty in their valuation). Most investment managers follow the limitations detailed in Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In particular, if soft dollar arrangements are entered into with respect to registered investment companies and pension plans (ERISA and public plans), compliance with Section 28(e) is generally required. However, hedge funds, which are generally not registered, may not be subject to the limitations of Section 28(e) and, thus, in some cases, the fund's commissions may be used for the adviser's benefit. In situations where fund commissions are used outside of the Section 28(e) safe harbor, full and comprehensive disclosure must be provided to fund investors.\n\n"

In addition to its regular symphony concerts, the ONBA serves as the accompanying orchestra for the Op\u00e9ra National de Bordeaux and the Ballet of the Op\u00e9ra National de Bordeaux. The ONBA also participates in such French music festivals as La Folle Journ\u00e9e (Nantes) and the Festival de La Roque-d'Anth\u00e9ron. The ONBA receives financial support from the Mairie de Bordeaux, the French Ministry of Culture and the Conseil R\u00e9gional d\u2019Aquitaine (Regional Council of Aquitaine).\nThe ONBA has its historical roots in two instrumental ensembles based in Bordeaux. The first was the Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Sainte-C\u00e9cile (Orchestra of the Saint Cecilia Society), established in 1853 by the conductor of the Grand-Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux, Charles M\u00e9zeray. The second organisation dated from 1932, the Association des Professeurs du Conservatoire (Association of Professors of the Conservatoire), which Gaston Poulet, the director of the city's conservatory, established.  In 1940, the two ensembles were essentially merged, under the direction of Poulet, to form the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire (Society of Conservatory Concerts). This ensemble worked also with the Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bordeaux.\nAfter World War II, Poulet stood down from the Conservatoire de Bordeaux and the orchestra. The orchestra was renamed the Orchestre Philharmonique de Bordeaux, and a new leader took over both the orchestra and the conservatory, Georges Carr\u00e8re, who served until 1963. In 1963, Jacques Pernoo became the orchestra's director, and the orchestra changed names again, to the Orchestre Symphonique de Bordeaux. In 1972, the orchestra acquired another new name, the Orchestre de Bordeaux Aquitaine. In the wake of the \"decentralisation\" policies of Marcel Landowski in French music funding, the orchestra enhanced its regional activities. During the leadership of its then-music director, Roberto Benzi, the orchestra attained a strength of 95 musicians. With the subsequent music directorship of Alain Lombard, from 1988 to 1995, the orchestra received its current name, the Orchestre National Bordeaux Aquitaine, and expanded to its present complement of around 120 musicians.\nThe ONBA's current music director is the American conductor Joseph Swensen, starting with the 2024-2025 season.  Past principal guest conductors of the ONBA have included Yutaka Sado, from 1999 to 2004. The ONBA has made commercial recordings for such labels as Naxos Records, harmonia mundi, and Mirare.\n\n"

The sculptor, Gutzon Borglum, named it the Shrine of Democracy, and oversaw the execution from 1927 to 1941 with the help of his son, Lincoln Borglum. The sculpture features the 60-foot-tall (18 m) heads of four United States presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln, chosen to represent the nation's birth, growth, development, and preservation. Mount Rushmore attracts more than two million visitors annually to the memorial park which covers 1,278 acres (2.00 sq mi; 5.17 km2). The mountain's elevation is 5,725 feet (1,745 m) above sea level.\nBorglum chose Mount Rushmore in part because it faces southeast for maximum sun exposure. The carving was the idea of Doane Robinson, a historian for the state of South Dakota. Robinson originally wanted the sculpture to feature American West heroes, such as Lewis and Clark, their expedition guide Sacagawea, Oglala Lakota chief Red Cloud, Buffalo Bill Cody, and Oglala Lakota chief Crazy Horse. Borglum chose the four presidents instead.\nPeter Norbeck, U.S. senator from South Dakota, sponsored the project and secured federal funding. Construction began in 1927 and the presidents' faces were completed between 1934 and 1939. After Gutzon Borglum died in March 1941, his son Lincoln took over as leader of the construction project. Each president was originally to be depicted from head to waist, but lack of funding forced construction to end on October 31, 1941, and only Washington's sculpture includes any detail below chin level.\nThe sculpture at Mount Rushmore is built on land that was illegally taken from the Sioux Nation in the 1870s. The Sioux continue to demand return of the land, and in 1980 the US Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians that the taking of the Black Hills required just compensation, and awarded the tribe $102 million. The Sioux have refused the money, and demand the return of the land. This conflict continues, leading some critics of the monument to refer to it as a \"Shrine of Hypocrisy\"."

Following The Bahamas becoming an independent nation in 1973, The Scout Association of the Bahamas was constituted on 1 August 1974 and succeeded The Scout Association Bahamas Branch. The Association became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in the same year. The Scout Association of the Bahamas was incorporated on 19 November 1975.\nThe coeducational Scout Association of the Bahamas had 1,060 members in 2010 and has 644 members as of 2021.\nThe Scouts own a 30-acre (120,000 m2) recreational site in Adelaide Village, New Providence. The site was donated to the Scouts by the Bahamian government in 1926. It is used for activities such as camping and hiking.\nThe emblem of The Scout Association of the Bahamas features a very stylized marlin and flamingo head, topped by a rounded black arrowhead, in the colors of the flag of the Bahamas. Until 2015, the Association's emblem included a marlin and flamingo, the heraldic supporters of the coat of arms of the Bahamas, as well as the flag of the Bahamas.\n\n"

She found thousands of documents with which she was able to reconstruct most elements of a largely unknown chapter of the history of Canada and of the Basque Country: the Basque cod and whale fisheries in Terra Nova especially in the 16th century. She discovered the existence of a 16th-century Basque whaling industry in southern Labrador and adjacent Quebec, their whaling ports, archaeological remains of their bases, as well as the presence of Basque galleons sunk in those ports, among them the San Juan (1565).\nIn 1981, she was awarded the Order of Canada for her pioneering work and for having made \"one of the most outstanding contributions, in recent years, to the story of this nation\". One of those whaling ports found by her, present-day Red Bay, Labrador, has been declared a National Historic Site of Canada (1979) and a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (June 2013). She was made an Officer of the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador in 2015."

Kelvin did not provide a text for his course and Hathaway made notes in short-hand. He wrote up the notes and duplicated them with a Papyrograph, a recent stencil-based device. As the demand outstripped the supply, Hathaway corresponded with Kelvin back in Glasgow to prepare for proper publication. After nineteen years the lectures were published.

Governor of Maryland, 437 U.S. 117 (1978), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States upheld a Maryland law prohibiting oil producers and refiners from operating service stations within its borders. The challengers, including Exxon, claimed that the law violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. Justice Stevens wrote for the majority, which disagreed with Exxon et al.: \"Since Maryland's entire gasoline supply flows in interstate commerce and since there are no local producers or refiners, such claims of disparate treatment between interstate and local commerce would be meritless.\" Exxon challenged the Maryland statute in Circuit Court which ruled the statute invalid. The Maryland Court of Appeals reversed the ruling."

He was runner-up to Wilson Kiprop at the Roma-Ostia Half Marathon in March, running a time of 59:19 minutes which would rank him sixth globally that year. Later that same month he was runner-up at the Stramilano, but his following outings were less successful, finishing outside the top eight in Yangzhou, Lille and Delhi. He acted as a pacemaker for the 2013 Frankfurt Marathon.\nChemosin's strong personal best from 2013 earned him a place for the 2014 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, but he was the worst performer among the Kenyan team, finishing in 24th place more than two and a half minutes behind fellow Kenyan and race winner Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor. His best result of the year came again at the Roma-Ostia race where he was fifth in a time of 60:24 minutes. He was again down the rankings at the Luanda Half Marathon, taking twelfth.\nIn 2015 Chemosin won second place in Warsaw with 2:08:05 to his record and $15,000 in cash. In October of the same year he competed at the Toronto Marathon where he got in fourth with a 2:09:38 run and then became a winner of Rome-Ostia Half Marathon with 59:37 to his credit."
